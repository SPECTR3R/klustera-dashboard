## Objective

Create an app using a framework such as Angular, Vue or React, that consumes and displays statistical data from a proprietary API. In order to get data from the API, the app must contain a login form to fetch an access token that expires in two hours. The app should look like this:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
  <img src="./public/objective.png" width="600px" />
</div>

## Result

I created the app using React for the logic and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for the styling. I implemented the agile methodology known as kanban, hitting a Development time of 20 hours, you can view my board [here](https://trello.com/b/CqkN27Cy/klustera-test-app). The result looks like this:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
  <img src="./public/result.png" width="600px" />
</div>

## Deployed Site

I used vercel to deploy the app to the world. You can visit it [here](https://klustera-test-app.vercel.app/).
